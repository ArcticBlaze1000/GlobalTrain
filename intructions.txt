That's an excellent idea. It introduces a much-needed workflow and a clear separation of concerns between event creation, administrative review, and final publication for trainers. It's a significant but very logical enhancement.

Based on your description, here is a detailed breakdown of how I envision implementing this.

### The Plan: An Event Lifecycle System

We will introduce a `status` field to the `datapack` table to track the state of each event. The lifecycle would look like this:

1.  **`new`**: A registration form has been started but not yet completed and submitted. It is effectively a draft.
2.  **`admin`**: The form has been submitted and is now pending review by an administrator. The admin needs to verify or add their required files.
3.  **`cleared`**: The admin has approved the event. It is now "live" and visible to trainers on the `Course` and `Candidate` screens.

Here is a diagram illustrating the flow:

Hereâ€™s how we would implement this across the application:

#### 1. Database Modification

*   I will add a new column named `status` to the `datapack` table.
*   The `status` will be of type `TEXT` and will have a `DEFAULT` value of `'new'`. This ensures that any new registration automatically starts in the correct draft state.

#### 2. `CreationScreen.jsx` Changes

*   **New "In-Progress" List**: Below the "New Register" button, I will add a list that displays all events currently in the `'new'` state. This will allow you to select a draft and continue working on it.
*   **Loading Drafts**: When you click on an in-progress event, the form will be populated with all the saved data from the `datapack` and its associated `trainees`.
*   **Updated Save Logic**:
    *   The "Create New Event" button will be repurposed. When you are filling out a form for a `'new'` event, clicking this button will now change its status from `'new'` to `'admin'`.
    *   I'll also implement a "Save Draft" functionality so you can save your progress on a `'new'` register without submitting it for admin review.

#### 3. `AdminScreen.jsx` Changes

*   **New "Pending Review" Section**: To keep things clean, I propose adding a new tab or a distinct section on the Admin screen (e.g., next to "Courses" and "Flags") called "Pending Events".
*   This section will display a list of all events that have the status `'admin'`.
*   Here, the admin will be able to perform their necessary actions (like adding files, which we can build out next). For now, it will just display the event.
*   Crucially, the admin will have a button here to **"Approve"** an event, which will change its status from `'admin'` to `'cleared'`.

#### 4. `CourseScreen.jsx` & `CandidateScreen.jsx` Changes

*   This is a straightforward but important change. The logic that fetches events for these screens will be updated to only show `datapacks` where `status = 'cleared'`.
*   This ensures that trainers and other users only see events that have been fully created and approved by an administrator, which is the main goal of this new workflow.

This plan establishes a clear, multi-stage process for event management. How does this detailed approach sound to you? Does it align with your vision for the feature?
