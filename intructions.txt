This is an excellent idea. You've identified the core issue with the current system: the business logic for what makes a form "complete" is hard-coded into the frontend components. Your proposal to move this logic into the database schema itself is a much more robust and scalable solution.

Let me summarize my understanding of your proposal and my thoughts on it.

### Your Proposed System:

1.  **Schema-Driven Logic:**
    *   We'll add two new columns to the `questionnaires` table:
        *   `required` (TEXT): With possible values `'yes'`, `'no'`, or `'dependant'`.
        *   `dependency` (TEXT): This will hold a comma-separated list of `field_name`s that this question depends on. It's only used when `required` is `'dependant'`.
    *   This completely removes the need for the frontend to have complex, hard-coded filtering rules. The "rules" for completion now live with the data itself.

2.  **Centralized Progress Storage:**
    *   The `document_progress` table becomes the single source of truth for completion percentages.
    *   The frontend's job is simply to *display* this percentage.

3.  **Simplified Calculation Flow:**
    *   When a user answers a question in a form, the response is saved.
    *   After saving, a process is triggered to recalculate the progress for that specific document.
    *   This process reads the new `required` and `dependency` columns to figure out the total number of currently active questions and how many have been completed.
    *   The resulting percentage is saved directly into the `document_progress` table.
    *   The UI automatically reflects this new, saved percentage.

### My Assessment:

I think this is a fantastic plan.

*   **Pros:**
    *   **Maintainability:** It will be dramatically easier to change the completion requirements for a form in the future. You'll just need to update the database entries, not deploy new application code.
    *   **Decoupling:** The frontend code will become much simpler and cleaner. The complex `useMemo` hooks and filtering logic will disappear, making the components easier to understand and manage.
    *   **Performance:** We'll be offloading calculation from the user's machine. The UI will only need to fetch a single percentage value, which is more efficient than running complex loops in JavaScript.
    *   **Flexibility:** The dependency system is very powerful and allows for creating complex, dynamic forms in a structured way.

*   **Challenges:**
    *   **Implementation Effort:** This is a significant refactor, touching the database schema, the main process, and multiple frontend components.
    *   **Data Migration:** We will need to go through all existing questions in your database and set appropriate values for the new `required` and `dependency` columns.

Overall, the long-term benefits in maintainability and clarity are well worth the initial effort. This is the right way to build this feature.

### Proposed Action Plan:

If you agree, here is how I propose we tackle this, step-by-step:

1.  **Database Schema Update:** I'll start by modifying `init-db.js` to add the `required` and `dependency` columns to the `questionnaires` table.
2.  **Backend Calculation Engine:** I will create a new function in `main.js`, exposed via `ipcMain`, that takes a `datapackId`, `documentId`, and `traineeId`. This function will perform the new, centralized progress calculation and update the `document_progress` table.
3.  **Refactor `QuestionnaireForm.jsx`:** I'll gut the old progress calculation logic from the form. I'll modify its `save` functions to call the new backend calculation engine after every update.
4.  **Refactor `CourseScreen.jsx` & `CandidateScreen.jsx`:** I will simplify these components to remove their calculation loops. They will be modified to fetch progress directly from the `document_progress` table.
5.  **Data Migration:** Once the code is ready, we will need to update your existing data. I can help with a script or guide you on how to set the `required` and `dependency` values for your current set of questions.

What do you think of this plan? Are you ready to begin?
