so now what i want is when a modal is filled in, update the nevvessary fields so for

ID -> auto generate
title -> from modal
datapack id -> if applicable take the context datapack
doc id -> if applicable take the currently opened doc 
trainee id -> if applicable take the currently candidate id from trainee column
user id -> id of the person sending the prompt
user sent to -> the id the prompt is sent to
message -> from modal
status -> the current status of the flag (we'll make a way to change it later)
context -> remove this column from the table, not needed
created_at -> time stamp of the sent button
pickedupat -> (a new column) will be the time an admin or dev pick up the request
resolvedat -> time stamp for when it was resolved
resolvedby -> id of the person who resolved it (even tho the user can specificy who they want to see doesnt mean that person will)
resolution notes -> any comments the resolver makes
signature -> signature by the resolver when completing

so just apply the ones applicable for the stage were at but this is how theyre gonna be filled in, also make the change to the table so it reflectes the change in the columns
